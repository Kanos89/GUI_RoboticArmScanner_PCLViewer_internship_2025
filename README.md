# GUI_RoboticArmScanner_PCLViewer_internship_2025
Implementing learned aspects of robotics in this little project : -connecting to a robotic arm, to control different preprogrammed positions -connecting to a scanner to perform multiple scans -allowing to open a pcl from the system and perform multiple operations on it (such as filters, meshing...)
